- This code performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using a Naive Bayes model.
- The reviews dataset is imported from the nltk library and split into training and testing data.
- The textual reviews are transformed into numerical representations using CountVectorizer.
- The model is trained on the training data to classify reviews as positive or negative based on the words present.
- After training, the model's accuracy is evaluated on the test set.
- Additionally, the code allows testing the model with new reviews to analyze their sentiment.
- Libraries such as pandas and sklearn are used for data handling and modeling.
- The model is simple, fast, and suitable for analyzing short text data.
